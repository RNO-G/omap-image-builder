RNO-G Disk Image Creation Tools

Based on RobertCNelson's omap image builder. 

This should be run on an ARM system (I use an rpi 4). 


Basic procedure: 
- set RNO_G_PASSWORD correctly 
- sudo ./rno-g_image.sh # (once per image) 
- insert SD card
- sudo ./rno-g_deploy /dev/sdX $station_number # (once per SD card, can do different station numbers in parallel in theory) 

The produced-SD card will autoflash the internal mmc on first boot with a
basically identical version of itself (mounting /data from the sdcard). After
that it will boot off mmc by default unless sysboot2 is low on startup. 


TODO:
- figure out LTE networking (probably will be handled by rno-g-BBB-scripts make install) 
- ???
